Visualizing Highway Fatalities
====

A tool that visualizes data maintained by FARS of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from 2001-10. The tool is intended to help a user to visualize various aspects/causes of highway accidents using maps and graphs, and thus allowing a meaningful analysis of existing data. This application has been optimized for a 8160x2304 px (52 inch) touch-screen at UIC's EVL Lab. A scaled down version is available to be run on smaller screens as well.

Developed using: Java, Processing, Modest Maps, SQLite, Omicron API
